# GenAI_with_LangChain

This repository contains code and notebooks for learning and experimenting with Generative AI using LangChain, OpenAI, Ollama, and HuggingFace. The project demonstrates document ingestion, transformation, and embedding techniques for building LLM-powered applications.

## Folder Structure

## Folder Details

- **1-Langchain/**  
  Contains introductory material and examples for getting started with LangChain, including basic components and application setup.

- **3.2-DataIngestion/**  
  Demonstrates how to ingest documents from various sources (PDF, web, text, XML) using LangChain document loaders.

- **3.3-DataTrnasformer/**  
  Shows how to transform and split documents using different text splitting strategies (character, HTML, JSON) for downstream processing.

- **4-Embeddings/**  
  Explores generating vector embeddings from documents using OpenAI, Ollama, and HuggingFace models, and storing them in vector databases.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Set up your `.env` file with necessary API keys.
3. Open the notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code) and follow the examples.
